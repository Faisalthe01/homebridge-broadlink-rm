## Documentation

Full documentation can be found [here](https://lprhodes.github.io/slate/). With the following additional configuration options available:

### Switch Accessory

key | description | example | default
--- | ----------- | ------- | -------
pingGrace (optional) | Pauses ping status changes for the specified period (seconds) to allow device to start-up/shutdown after the change | 15 | 10

### Aircon Accessory

key | description | example | default
--- | ----------- | ------- | -------
w1DeviceID (optional) | Updates device current temperature from a Raspberry Pi Wire-1 thermometers (i.e. ds18b20). Value is the Device ID | 28-0321544e531ff | 

#### "data" key-value object
The device can be setup to manage modes in one of two ways. If your AC unit accepts a hexcade to change mode only (without temperature details) you can set the mode keys (heat/cool) and then the temperatureX values to change the teperature. If your AC unit sends hexcodes that contain the mode AND temperature you can use the modeX codes alone.

When the mode is changed the mode hexcodes are sent first - if set. Then the modeX code is sent to set the temperature, if it is set. If a matching modeX code can't be found, the temperatureX code is sent.  If neither of these temperature codes are found either defaultHeatTemperature or defaultCoolTemperature codes will be used depending on if the target Temperature is higher or lower than the current temperature.

key | description
--- | -----------
off | A hex code string to be sent when the air conditioner is asked to be turned off.
temperatureX | A hex code string where X is any temperature you wish to support e.g. "temperature30".
modeX | A hex code string where X is any temperture, and mode is one of "heat","cool", or "auto". Hex code used to set unit to the specified mode and temperature

#### "temperatureX" and "modeX" key-value object

key | description
--- | -----------
data | Hex data stored as string.
pseudo-mode (optional) | The mode we set when this hex is sent. i.e. "heat" or "cool". For graphical purposes only (hence use of the term "pseudo"). Not recommended for ModeX key-values.

pingIPAddress | When an IP address is provided, it is pinged every second. If a response is received then the TV turns on, otherwise it turns off. | "192.167.1.77" |
pingIPAddressStateOnly | Using this option will prevent the hex code from being sent when the state changes | true | false
pingFrequency | The frequency in seconds that the IP address should be pinged | 5 | 1
pingGrace (optional) | Pauses ping status changes for the specified period (seconds) to allow device to start-up/shutdown after the change | 15 | 10
